# Learning BS4 ðŸ˜«

> This repo contains code corresponding (roughly) to the Academind tutorial series
> [Bootstrap 4 Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51rLqH4-8LBVlUTIFF70dxhb) on Youtube

## What.

- After skimming the "Concepts and Setup" video in the playlist, note that I am not including any code on that lesson, just go copy and paste the latest script tags from the [official Bootstrap site](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) into a new html file, fire up a static http server (good ol' [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) is great here), and get to work
- `lessons/` contains the demos by lesson, with `notes.md` files in each
- `lessons/_template` is pretty much a blank that you can easily copy to start a new lesson
  - Todo- maybe make this into a [Plop](https://plopjs.com/documentation/) template

## Why

- I'm coming from Bootstrap 3 and wanted to learn my way around the framework "the right way" so i"m not re-implementing redundant functionality
- I have been ashamed about winging it for 2 years with BS4 and need to invest an hour or two in actually learning it
- I'm also forcing myself to write notes in Markdown, because it is less distracting than switching back and forth to OneNote
